        <p>
        Hey! I’m Amardeep — a curious soul on a journey through life and ideas. By day, I write code in fintech; by heart, I wander as an artist, exploring problems and possibilities.  
        I’ve learned to follow the logic of discovery, letting each challenge write its own code as I move forward.  
        Some days, I’m juggling projects and hobbies, trying to find balance between ambition and curiosity.  
        Timetables and a little organization keep me grounded, while songs, books, journaling, movies, chess, FIFA, gym, cricket, cooking (still learning), coding, and discovering new places color the journey.  
        Every step is about observing, experimenting, and learning — always learning, always exploring, always alive in the process.
        </p>
